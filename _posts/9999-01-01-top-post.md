## Welcome to homepage of WHDD project

WHDD is a HDD diagnostic and data recovery tool for Linux.
It is capable of testing a hard drive with reading and writing, providing intuitive visualization of the process. Visualization or these tests is very similar to MHDD.
Amongst others, there is a function for copying the device. The copying procedure algorithms are optimized for least harm to already-defective source device. The meaning of this becomes clear in a demo.
WHDD may work with your hard drives on low level, sending ATA commands to device, the benefits are:

 - no system freeze while accessing damaged device (device is soft-reset on timeout);
 - better timing precision.

We’re happy to bring such a good tool for you, but **note that there’s no warranty! You’re on your own!**

**Enjoy!**
